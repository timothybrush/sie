# Contract review with the OpenAI Agents SDK, on one SIE cluster

A multi-agent contract reviewer built with the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) where **every model call is served by SIE** — no `api.openai.com`, no per-token bill. An **investigator** agent autonomously calls tools to gather grounded facts, then a **synthesizer** agent turns them into a structured review — each step running on the **right model from the SIE catalog**: a fast triage model, a vision model that reads the scanned signature page, a reasoning sub-agent for clause risk, a text-to-SQL specialist, an OCR model, embedding + reranker models for clause search, a zero-shot entity extractor, and a safety guardrail. Ten specialized jobs, one cluster, one request.

This is the "one cluster powers every model your agent calls" idea from the [SIE landing page](https://superlinked.com), made real and runnable.

## The catalog: the right model for each job

Every value below is a real model in the [SIE catalog](https://superlinked.com/models). Swap any line in `config.yaml` to try another — nothing else changes.

| Role in the agent | SIE model | SIE function |
|---|---|---|
| Triage — classify the document type | `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` | chat |
| **Orchestrator** — plan, call tools, assemble the review | `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` (alias `code`) | chat + tools + JSON schema |
| Vision — read the scanned signature page | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` | chat + image |
| Reasoning sub-agent — clause-risk analysis | `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` (↑ `Qwen3.5-4B` / `Qwen3.6-27B` where served) | chat |
| Text-to-SQL — query the obligations DB | `defog/sqlcoder-7b-2` | completions |
| Guardrail — safety / prompt-injection | `ibm-granite/granite-guardian-3.0-2b` (alias `guard`) | chat |
| OCR — scanned page → markdown | `lightonai/LightOnOCR-2-1B` | extract |
| Clause search — dense embeddings | `BAAI/bge-m3` | encode |
| Clause rerank — cross-encoder | `Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-4B` | score |
| Entity extraction — parties, dates, amounts | `urchade/gliner_large-v2.1` | extract |

## How it works

The whole trick is one idea: **the Agents SDK speaks the OpenAI wire protocol, and SIE serves an OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint.** So we point the SDK at SIE and force chat completions (`contract_review_agent/runtime.py`):

```python
client = AsyncOpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1", api_key="not-needed")
set_default_openai_client(client)        # every agent talks to SIE...
set_default_openai_api("chat_completions")  # ...over chat completions, not the Responses API...
set_tracing_disabled(True)               # ...and we never phone home with traces.
```

After that, each `Agent` just names the SIE model it should run on:

```python
Agent(name="Risk Analyst", model=OpenAIChatCompletionsModel("Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507", openai_client=client), ...)
```

The flow is **two agents** (which is what keeps a small open model reliable):

1. An **investigator** (on `Qwen3-4B-Instruct`) with seven tools and **no** structured `output_type` — so it can't short-circuit to a hallucinated answer and instead must call tools to learn anything about the contract:
   - `classify_document` (triage) · `read_signature_page` (vision) · `analyze_clause_risks` (delegates to the reasoning **sub-agent**) — generative LLMs
   - `ocr_signature_page` · `extract_entities` (`extract`), `search_clauses` (`encode` + `score`), `query_obligations_db` (`completions`) — retrieval & extraction
   - a `granite-guardian` **input guardrail** screens the request first (and fails open, logged, if the guard model is unavailable).
2. A **synthesizer** (structured `output_type=ContractReview`, no tools) turns the investigator's grounded findings into the final review — parties, dates, governing law, executed?, key obligations, risk flags with severity + redlines, recommendation — via SIE's JSON-schema-constrained generation.

> Why two agents? With a structured `output_type`, a small model tends to emit the schema immediately and skip the tools (it will even hallucinate the fields). Splitting "gather with tools" from "format the result" keeps the fan-out real and the output grounded.

## Run it

You need Python 3.12 and a **GPU-backed SIE deployment** — the generative models run on SIE's generation bundle (CUDA), so the `latest-cpu-default` image can't serve them.

```bash
# 1. SIE on a local NVIDIA GPU, or point SIE_CLUSTER_URL / SIE_API_KEY at a managed GPU cluster.
docker run --gpus all -p 8080:8080 -v sie-hf-cache:/app/.cache/huggingface \
  ghcr.io/superlinked/sie-server:latest-cuda12-default

cd examples/contract-review-agent
cp .env.example .env          # edit SIE_CLUSTER_URL / SIE_API_KEY if not localhost
uv sync

# 2. Fetch a handful of real contracts from CUAD (CC BY 4.0). Downloads a ~18 MB archive once.
uv run fetch-contracts                 # or: uv run make-sample  (offline synthetic contracts)

# 3. Review the first contract and watch the model fan-out.
uv run review                          # uv run review --list   to see available contracts
uv run review --contract <slug>        # review a specific one
```

> **GPU sizing.** `reasoning` defaults to `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` (reliable, fast) so the demo
> runs on a single mid-size GPU; swap in the newer `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B` or the stronger `Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B` (H100/RTX PRO 6000) where the cluster serves them. A cold
> cluster pays a one-time load per model on first use; the agent retries the "still
> provisioning" responses under `cluster.provision_timeout_s`. Keep bundles warm
> (`minReplicas: 1`) to skip the wait — and any model the cluster can't serve degrades
> gracefully (logged in the ledger) instead of failing the run.

## What you'll see

`uv run review` prints the model catalog, runs the agent, then prints the structured review **plus a per-model observability ledger** — each step's model, SIE function, **cold-start warm-up**, warm latency, data sent, and **warm throughput (tokens/s)** — so you can watch one cluster fan a single request across the catalog and see how each model performed. (Warm-up is shown separately from throughput for the generative calls; the `encode`/`score`/`extract` calls go through the SIE SDK, which provisions internally, so those show total latency.) Try `--instruction "..."` to change the ask, or feed the guardrail a malicious prompt to watch `granite-guardian` trip the tripwire.

## Swapping models (the point of the catalog)

`config.yaml` maps each role to a model id. Change a string, rerun — no code edits:

```yaml
models:
  reasoning: "Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B"               # default 4B runs anywhere; bump to 27B on an H100-class cluster
  ocr: "opendatalab/MinerU2.5-Pro-2604-1.2B"  # try a different OCR model
```

Alternatively, resolve roles **server-side** with SIE's gateway aliases — set
`SIE_GATEWAY_MODEL_ALIASES='{"vision":"Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B","ocr":"lightonai/LightOnOCR-2-1B"}'`
and reference `vision` / `ocr` (the built-ins `code`, `sql`, `guard` already ship).

## Data

The default corpus is **[CUAD](https://www.atticusprojectai.org/cuad/)** (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset) — 510 real commercial contracts filed with the SEC, released by The Atticus Project under **CC BY 4.0**. `fetch-contracts` downloads CUAD's ~18 MB archive once (from the [Atticus Project repo](https://github.com/TheAtticusProject/cuad)), parses the SQuAD-format contract text, writes a curated handful as the corpus, renders one page to an image for the OCR/vision step, and seeds a small SQLite obligations database that references the contracts pulled.

`uv run make-sample` builds a fully synthetic, offline alternative (an Acme MSA, an NDA, and an SOW) so the demo runs with no network.

## Notes

- Chat completions, tool calling, JSON-schema structured output, vision, and `/v1/completions` (for `sqlcoder`) are all served over SIE's OpenAI-compatible API.
- `sqlcoder-7b-2` is a completion model used with its native text-to-SQL template; for higher accuracy you can instead point `sql` at the `code`-aliased instruct model.
- This is a demo of inference orchestration, **not legal advice**.
