# Master Services Agreement

This Master Services Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between
Northwind Analytics, Inc. ("Customer") and Acme Cloud Services, LLC ("Provider").

## 1. Definitions
"Services" means the cloud data-processing services described in one or more
Order Forms. "Order Form" means an ordering document executed by both parties
that references this Agreement.

## 2. Term and Renewal
The initial term of this Agreement is twelve (12) months from the Effective
Date. Thereafter, this Agreement automatically renews for successive twelve (12)
month terms unless Customer provides written notice of non-renewal at least
ninety (90) days before the end of the then-current term. Fees for each renewal
term may increase by up to ten percent (10%) over the prior term.

## 3. Fees and Payment
Customer shall pay all fees within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.
Late amounts accrue interest at 1.5% per month. All fees are non-refundable,
including fees for partially used subscription periods.

## 4. Termination
Provider may terminate this Agreement or any Order Form for convenience upon
thirty (30) days written notice. Customer may terminate only for Provider's
uncured material breach, after a sixty (60) day cure period. Upon termination,
Customer shall pay all fees due through the end of the then-current term.

## 5. Limitation of Liability
EXCEPT FOR CUSTOMER'S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND CUSTOMER'S INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS, EACH PARTY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES
PAID BY CUSTOMER IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. PROVIDER SHALL NOT
BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

## 6. Indemnification
Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Provider from any and all
claims arising out of Customer's use of the Services, without limitation. This
indemnity is uncapped and survives termination of this Agreement.

## 7. Confidentiality
Each party shall protect the other's Confidential Information using at least a
reasonable standard of care, and shall not disclose it except to personnel with
a need to know who are bound by confidentiality obligations.

## 8. Data Protection
Provider shall process Customer personal data only on Customer's documented
instructions and shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational
security measures. Provider may engage sub-processors, provided Provider remains
liable for their performance.

## 9. Service Levels
Provider targets 99.9% monthly availability. If availability falls below the
target, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy is a service credit equal to 5% of
the monthly fee per 0.1% below target, capped at 25% of the monthly fee.

## 10. Governing Law
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to its conflict-of-laws principles. The parties consent to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware.

## 11. Assignment
Customer may not assign this Agreement without Provider's prior written consent.
Provider may assign this Agreement freely, including to an acquirer of all or
substantially all of its assets.

## 12. Entire Agreement
This Agreement, together with all Order Forms, constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements on its subject matter.
