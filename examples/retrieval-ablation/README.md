# Find the best retrieval strategy for your RAG

RAG quality lives or dies by the retrieval step. Most teams pick a
retrieval pipeline by feel, by averaged leaderboard scores, or by what
is already in the stack. None of those tell you how each strategy
actually performs on your data, so the surprises show up in production.

The cure is straightforward to describe and historically painful to
run: define a representative benchmark, evaluate every reasonable
retrieval strategy on it, and pick by a single metric. The painful
part has always been infrastructure, since most teams give up after
wiring two or three different model serving stacks.

This example shows what that workflow looks like when one inference
cluster can serve every retrieval, reranking, and multi-vector model
the experiment needs. The result is the recipe below, the methodology
that produced it, and the numbers that ruled out every alternative.

**The setup.** Six bank 10-K filings from SEC EDGAR, 1,854 real
queries, 2,942 pages, eight retrieval strategies, ranked by NDCG@10.
The recipe at the top won the evals; the [Evidence](#evidence)
section lists every other combination tried and what each scored.

One SIE cluster, seven models, three API calls. No model serving to
manage.

## The recipe

**Dual multi-vector retrieval, then cross-encoder rerank.**

1. Encode queries and pages with two multi-vector models,
   `BAAI/bge-m3` (1024d) and `jinaai/jina-colbert-v2` (128d), to get
   complementary retrieval pools.
2. Rerank the combined candidate pool with `mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-large-v2`.

On 1,854 queries against 2,942 pages from six bank 10-K filings, this
pipeline hits **NDCG@10 = 0.621 and Recall@10 = 0.665**, 57% better
than a single dense model and 3× better than BM25 alone. Full
benchmarking numbers are in the [Evidence](#evidence) section below.

## The full pipeline in code

```python
from sie_sdk import SIEAsyncClient

async with SIEAsyncClient("http://your-sie-endpoint:8080", api_key="SL-...") as sie:
    # Multi-vector encode with two complementary models
    mv_bge = await sie.encode("BAAI/bge-m3", [{"text": "quarterly revenue"}],
                              output_types=["multivector"])

    mv_jina = await sie.encode("jinaai/jina-colbert-v2", [{"text": "quarterly revenue"}],
                               output_types=["multivector"])

    # Union the two pools, rerank with a cross-encoder
    result = await sie.score("mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-large-v2",
                             query={"text": "quarterly revenue"},
                             items=[{"text": "Revenue was $50B..."},
                                    {"text": "The board met on Tuesday..."}])
```

Three model families. One endpoint. No container orchestration.

## Run the full pipeline

```bash
# Install
uv sync

# Validate config (no GPU needed)
uv run python benchmark_ablation.py --dry-run

# Run the production pipeline end-to-end (all 7 models, all 1,854 queries)
uv run python benchmark_ablation.py --gpu l4-spot

# Or run just the winning combination (skip baselines and alternatives)
uv run python benchmark_ablation.py --gpu l4-spot --skip-conditions 1,2,3
```

All expensive operations (encoding, search) cache to `cache/ablation/`. Re-runs skip completed steps. Cross-encoder reranking checkpoints every 100 queries for crash recovery.

## Evidence

We benchmarked six retrieval strategies against the same 1,854 queries
on 2,942 pages from six bank 10-K filings. The recipe at the top came
out first on every metric:

| Strategy | Model | NDCG@10 | Recall@10 | What it shows |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Dual-MV → CE Rerank** | bge-m3+jina-colbert → mxbai-large | **0.621** | **0.665** | The recipe |
| MV pool → CE Rerank | MV-bge200 + mxbai-large | 0.613 | 0.656 | Single MV model + CE, nearly as good |
| CE Rerank | mxbai-rerank-large | 0.600 | 0.640 | +52% over vector; CE alone is strong |
| CE Rerank | mxbai-rerank-base | 0.524 | 0.588 | Smaller reranker, still strong |
| CE Rerank | bge-reranker | 0.521 | 0.578 | Near-identical to mxbai-base |
| MV Direct | bge-m3 (1024d) | 0.435 | 0.482 | No GPU at inference, +10% over vector |
| MV Rerank | jina-colbert-v2 (128d) | 0.431 | 0.494 | 96% of bge-m3 quality at 12.5% storage |
| Vector | bge-m3 dense | 0.396 | 0.438 | Single-model baseline |
| RRF | BM25+Vector | 0.358 | 0.434 | Hybrid hurts here; BM25 dilutes signal |
| BM25 | Turbopuffer FTS | 0.185 | 0.239 | Keyword search alone isn't enough |

See [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md) for full methodology, all benchmarking conditions, and pool-composition experiments.

## What this shows about SIE

- **Model-agnostic**: swap `bge-m3` for `jina-colbert-v2` with one parameter change
- **Multi-model pipelines**: two encoders plus a cross-encoder rerank in one script, one cluster
- **100+ models available**: not locked into one vendor's embeddings
- **Async-native**: fire hundreds of concurrent requests, SIE handles batching and GPU scheduling

## API Keys Required

| Service | What for | Get one at |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **SIE** | Encoding, scoring, multi-vector | Self-hosted ([deploy guide](https://github.com/superlinked/sie)) or contact team |
| **Turbopuffer** | BM25 + vector search index (free tier covers this dataset) | [turbopuffer.com](https://turbopuffer.com) |
| **HuggingFace** | Dataset download (free, cached) | [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) |

`SIE_API_KEY` is optional. Leave it unset for a local or otherwise
unauthenticated SIE deployment; set it only when your managed/auth-enabled
cluster requires one.

Create `.env` in this directory:

```
SIE_BASE_URL=http://your-sie-endpoint:8080
# Optional: only needed for managed/auth-enabled SIE clusters.
SIE_API_KEY=
TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY=tpuf_...
```

## Recipes by constraint

- **Best quality overall**: the dual-MV then CE rerank recipe above (NDCG=0.621).
- **No GPU at inference time**: multi-vector direct with `bge-m3` (NDCG=0.44). Pre-encode offline, search with MaxSim on CPU.
- **Best cost/quality**: `jina-colbert-v2` multi-vector (NDCG=0.43). 128-dim vectors equal 8× less storage than `bge-m3` multi-vector, nearly identical quality.
