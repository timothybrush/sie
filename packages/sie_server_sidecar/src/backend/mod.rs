//! Inference backend abstraction.
//!
//! A [`InferenceBackend`] is the thing the dispatcher calls to turn a
//! batch of `WorkItem`s into results. The queue-mode default is
//! [`AdapterWorkerPool`], which owns one IPC client per colocated adapter
//! child. [`PythonIpcBackend`] remains the single-socket IPC backend used by
//! tests and specialised call sites.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! The worker-sidecar owns NATS consumption, scheduling, and dispatch while
//! adapter processes own model execution over UDS + msgpack RPC. This trait
//! keeps those concerns separated: Python/PyTorch and Rust/Candle children can
//! share the dispatcher, IPC protocol, metrics, and config fanout paths.
//!
//! # Not a runtime fallback
//!
//! A [`BackendRouter`] composes multiple backends and routes each
//! operation to the first one that claims the model. Routing is
//! deterministic and config-driven (order of construction = priority).
//!
//! Critically, routing happens at readiness time — it is **not** a
//! retry-on-error fallback. If a native backend claims a model and
//! inference fails, the backend is responsible for fanning out
//! per-item error outcomes in an `Ok(BatchOutcome)` and the dispatcher
//! ACKs the messages (see the error handling contract below). The
//! router does **not** silently retry via Python. Numeric divergence
//! between two embedders is a correctness bug, not a feature, and we
//! refuse to paper over it.
//!
//! # Error handling contract
//!
//! The dispatcher's only lever is ACK vs NAK vs per-item publish. It
//! uses the backend's return value this way:
//!
//! * `Ok(BatchOutcome)` → dispatcher honours every [`crate::ipc_types::ItemOutcome`]'s
//!   [`crate::ipc_types::Disposition`]. A well-behaved backend that
//!   handles its own inference failures returns `Ok` with some items
//!   set to `PublishErrorAndAck` — the per-item path.
//! * `Err(BackendError::Transient)` → NAK the whole group with the
//!   base delay. Use for **infrastructure** failures (broken IPC pipe,
//!   CUDA unavailable, connection reset) where a different pod or the
//!   next redeliver might succeed.
//! * `Err(BackendError::UnsupportedModel)` → the router falls through
//!   to the next backend; if none claim it, the dispatcher NAKs so a
//!   different pod can pick it up.
//! * `Err(BackendError::Draining)` → NAK fast; we're shutting down.
//! * `Err(BackendError::Inference)` → **currently unused at the batch
//!   level.** Reserved for a future protocol where per-batch inference
//!   failure maps to synthetic per-item errors inside the dispatcher.
//!   Do not emit this from new backends — fan out to `PublishErrorAndAck`
//!   items inside `Ok(BatchOutcome)` instead. Emitting `Inference` today
//!   would cause the same retry-storm behaviour as `Transient`.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! * [`InferenceBackend::supports`] is advisory — used by the router
//!   to pick a backend cheaply before any RPC. The authoritative answer
//!   is [`InferenceBackend::ensure_model_ready`].
//! * [`InferenceBackend::ensure_model_ready`] returns the same
//!   [`EnsureModelReadyResponse`] the dispatcher already handles
//!   (Ready / LoadingStarted / LoadingInProgress / RetryLater plus an
//!   optional `batch_budget`). Backends populate it from their own
//!   load state; the dispatcher's NAK/ACK policy is unchanged.
//! * `process_*_batch` runs the batch and returns a [`BatchOutcome`]
//!   whose [`crate::ipc_types::ItemOutcome`]s drive per-message publish/ACK/NAK. The
//!   dispatcher has already capped the input at the budget reported
//!   by `ensure_model_ready`, so backends don't need to re-split.
//! * [`InferenceBackend::drain`] is called once at shutdown. The
//!   deadline is advisory — drains should finish promptly and never
//!   block shutdown indefinitely.
