"""Model-residency policy types.

This module is the first seam of the planned ResidencyPolicy (issue #1569),
which will eventually own the eviction decision, the LRU order, and the
OOM-recovery cooldown that are today spread across ``core/registry.py``,
``core/memory.py`` and ``core/worker/oom_recovery.py``.

It deliberately holds only leaf types so both the registry and the worker's
OOM-recovery executor can import it without a cycle (the worker must not
import the registry).
