"""Model worker for async request handling with dynamic batching.

The ModelWorker manages a single model's inference pipeline:
1. Accepts tokenized requests via submit()
2. Batches requests using BatchFormer
3. Runs inference on batches via operation handlers
4. Fans out results to waiting futures

Architecture:
- ModelWorker: Manages lifecycle, batching, FCFS scheduling, stats
- OperationHandler: Abstract interface for operation-specific logic
- EncodeHandler, ExtractHandler, ScoreHandler: Concrete implementations
