"""Batch formation for dynamic batching.

Accumulates requests until batch limits are reached, then returns a batch
ready for inference.

Batch formation loop:
1. Wait for first request
2. Start batch timer
3. Accumulate while: total_cost < max_batch_cost AND
                     num_requests < max_batch_requests AND
                     elapsed < max_batch_wait_ms
4. Sort by cost (reduces padding waste for text)
5. Split into optimal sub-batches respecting max_batch_cost
6. Return one sub-batch per get_batch() call

The key optimization is cost-sorted sub-batching:
- Items are sorted by cost (ascending)
- Each sub-batch contains similar-cost items
- This minimizes padding waste within each sub-batch

Cost semantics vary by modality (modality-native units):
- Text: cost = token count
- Images: cost = 1 per image (fixed dimensions)
- Vision (tiled): cost = tile count (1-N per image)
- Audio: cost = sample_count / chunk_size

These units are NOT commensurable across modalities, so ``total_cost`` is only
meaningful within a single modality (the common case — a model's batch is
single-modality). See docs/adr/0004 for why cost is kept modality-native
rather than unified onto a canonical unit.
