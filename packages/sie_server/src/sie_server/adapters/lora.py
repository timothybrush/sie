"""LoRA capability seam for adapters.

Groups the LoRA lifecycle an adapter exposes when it supports LoRA into one
typed capability, so callers ask ``adapter.lora_capability()`` once and use the
returned handle instead of flag-checking ``supports_lora()`` and then calling
the individual hooks. The two implementations behind this capability are the
PEFT mixin (in-process, hot-reloadable) and the SGLang adapter (HTTP, blocking).
