"""MLX adapter for autoregressive text generation on Apple Silicon.

The Mac-native generation backend. Generation runs in a managed
``mlx_lm.server`` subprocess (Apple's MLX framework, Metal-native) that this
adapter spawns and proxies — launched from the server's own environment (the
device-agnostic ``sglang`` bundle installs ``mlx-lm`` on Apple Silicon; see
:mod:`sie_server.adapters.mlx._server`). A subprocess rather than in-process
because ``mlx_lm.server`` already exposes the OpenAI ``/v1/completions`` server
this adapter proxies, and its own process gives clean single-tenant lifecycle +
Metal-memory isolation.

Selection is automatic: :meth:`SGLangGenerationAdapter.create_for_device`
swaps to this adapter on any non-CUDA device, so unsuffixed generation models
"just work" on a Mac (served via ``mise run serve -b sglang``).

Streaming async-iterator contract (same as the SGLang adapter). The adapter
opens an HTTP streaming connection to the child's OpenAI-compatible
``/v1/completions`` endpoint (``stream: true`` + ``stream_options.include_usage``),
parses the SSE, and yields :class:`GenerationChunk` objects. The terminal
chunk carries ``finish_reason`` plus prompt/completion token counts.

Cancellation: dropping the async iterator (``aclose()``) exits the
``httpx.stream`` context, closing the upstream connection — which the
single-tenant ``mlx_lm.server`` treats as a stop signal.
