"""Flash-vs-native parity for SPLADEFlashAdapter (#1685).

The packed flash path (hand-rolled attention + ``flash_attn_varlen_func``)
and the native path (the model's own eager forward) must produce the same
sparse vectors within fp16 tolerance. The 13.5% StackOverflowQA regression
shipped precisely because nothing pinned the two paths (and the floors)
to each other.

Needs CUDA + a working flash_attn, so it runs on the GPU lanes and is
skipped elsewhere (also gated behind the ``model`` marker because it
downloads the checkpoint).
