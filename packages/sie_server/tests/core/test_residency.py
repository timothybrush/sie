# Tests for the pure eviction-decision helper in core/residency.py.
#
# ``select_eviction_candidate`` is the *policy* half of
# ``ModelRegistry.evict_lru_excluding`` (the registry keeps the I/O half).
# Exercising it directly locks the LRU-walk skip rules without standing up a
# registry — the worker's OOM-recovery path must not import the registry.
