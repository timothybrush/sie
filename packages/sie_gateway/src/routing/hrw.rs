//! Highest-Random-Weight (rendezvous) hashing for direct-dispatch routing.
//!
//! Given a request hash and a snapshot of candidate workers, pick the
//! least-pressured worker and use the HRW score as the deterministic
//! tie-breaker. This is `O(n)` per pick, stable across all callers without
//! coordination for equal-pressure workers, and still degrades gracefully
//! when workers come and go.
//!
//! Snapshots are immutable. The
//! [`crate::state::worker_registry::WorkerRegistry`] owns the source
//! of truth; this module just consumes a borrowed slice of
//! `(worker_id, worker_id_hash)` pairs.
