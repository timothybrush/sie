"""Transient text chunking for ``answer_questions`` (#1309).

SIE has no chunking pipeline today, so this is a deliberately small,
self-contained primitive: a fixed-size sliding character window with overlap. It
runs entirely in the MCP edge per request — chunks are never persisted and no
index is built (the Req 12 "transient retrieval" boundary).

Character windows (not model-tokenizer windows) keep the job dependency-free and
predictable; sizes are expressed in characters and approximate a token budget at
the ~4-chars-per-token heuristic the edge already uses elsewhere. Precise token
accounting is the cluster's job, not the edge's.
