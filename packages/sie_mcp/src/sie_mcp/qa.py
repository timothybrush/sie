"""``answer_questions`` — the Req 12 transient-QA job (#1309).

Grounded question answering over a document set too large to drop whole into a
single context window. Composed from shipped SIE primitives and run client-side
in the MCP edge: TRANSIENT retrieval, so nothing is persisted between calls — no
standing index, no cross-call cache, no user-facing search (the M5 boundary).

Per request the chunks are encoded once; then, for each question, the job:

1. ``encode`` the question and rank chunks by dense cosine similarity to
   shortlist the most promising candidates — the cheap first pass that keeps a
   document larger than one context window tractable without reranking every
   chunk;
2. ``score`` (rerank) the shortlist with a cross-encoder to select the final
   passages;
3. generate an answer grounded ONLY in those passages, via a grounded
   chat-completion (system + passages + question).

Each answer is returned with the passages it used, so the grounding is visible.
