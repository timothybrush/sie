# Per-app write lock is stored on `app.state._config_write_lock` and
# lazily created on first use. We cannot use a module-level
# `asyncio.Lock()` here because `asyncio.Lock` binds to the running
# event loop the first time it's awaited; a module-level instance
# would therefore break any test that runs multiple
# `asyncio.run(...)` iterations against the same app, and would also
# fall apart if the process ever hosts more than one event loop
# (subinterpreters, threaded test harnesses, etc.). Storing the lock
# on `app.state` scopes its lifetime to the app and its event loop.
#
# Why serialize this critical section at all:
#   - `ConfigStore.increment_epoch` is a naive read-modify-write on
#     the epoch file. Concurrent writers would both read N, both
#     write N+1, and we'd lose an epoch bump (and the NATS monotonic
#     sequence number the gateway poller relies on).
#   - Disk persist must happen before the in-memory registry mutation
#     so a restart cannot observe a registry-only model that has no
#     backing YAML. That invariant only holds if nothing slips
#     between persist and mutate.
#   - NATS publish is part of the same "one write = one delta"
#     contract, so concurrent writes must serialize their publishes
#     to keep the epoch ordering on the wire monotonic per bundle.
#   - `GET /v1/configs/export` also takes this lock so its
#     `(epoch, models)` pair is a real serialization point; without
#     that, a gateway bootstrapping mid-write could receive an epoch
#     that is ahead of the models list and silently wedge on the
#     poller's `remote == local` "in sync" branch.
#
# All read endpoints (`/models`, `/bundles`, `/epoch`, ...) remain
# fully concurrent.

    Lightweight complement to `GET /v1/configs/export`. Called periodically
    by the Rust gateway's `state::config_poller` to detect drift on three
    independent axes:

    - ``epoch`` (int, monotonic): bumped on every model-config write. If the
      remote value is ahead of the gateway's local value, the gateway
      triggers a fresh ``/v1/configs/export`` fetch to catch up. Closes the
      NATS Core pub/sub delta-loss gap (pub/sub has no replay, so a
      disconnected gateway could otherwise silently fall behind).
    - ``bundles_hash`` (hex sha256, may be empty): fingerprint over the
      registry's full bundle surface (see ``ModelRegistry.compute_bundles_hash``).
      Bundles are filesystem artifacts baked into this image; their epoch is
      effectively "redeploy time", which the model epoch counter does not
      observe. The gateway re-fetches ``/v1/configs/bundles`` whenever this
      hash changes, independent of the model epoch — without it, a sie-config
      redeploy that adds a bundle would not propagate to the gateway until a
      coincidental model write or a manual gateway restart.
    - ``bundle_config_hashes_hash`` (hex sha256, may be empty): fingerprint
      over the per-bundle config hashes exported by ``/v1/configs/export``
      plus model-level pool ownership. This catches filesystem-baseline or
      no-store config drift where the epoch remains unchanged but workers and
      sie-config agree on a new ``bundle_config_hash`` or model pool
      assignment that stale gateways have not installed yet.

    Intentionally uses read auth rather than admin auth — the epoch is a
    monotonic integer counter and the hash is a one-way digest; neither
    reveals anything sensitive and broadening the caller set (SRE tooling,
    monitoring) beyond the admin-token holder keeps operational surface
    cheap.

    (i.e. "this model was added in epoch E, but the snapshot says we're
    at E+1 and the model is missing from the `models` list"). If that
    escapes to a gateway, the poller will see `remote == local`, log
    "in sync", and silently leave the gateway missing the model forever

    We enforce consistency the cheapest way: take the per-app write
    lock around the snapshot. Writers serialize on the same lock so
    the snapshot is always "between writes". Export is a rare
